      <h3 class="section-title">ABOUT MOE CLEAN &amp; MORE</h3>
      <p>My name is Maureen Nauslar, I started Moe Clean & More in 1995 to support my son's choice of sport, to be a competitive gymnast.  While working full time at KWCH-TV, I started cleaning for co-workers; many whom I still clean for.  I was laid off in 2009 and decided to go Full-Time with Moe Clean & More and bring in co-workers to help Moe Clean & More grow.  It is now 2016 and I am very happy with the choices I made; that made Moe Clean & More a successful company!
